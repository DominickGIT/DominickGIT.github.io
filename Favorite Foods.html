  <h2>Favorite Foods;</h2>
    
    <p>I have a variety of foods that I love and try often. I'm adventurous, and I love trying new things such as assorted Korean cuisine and spins on famous Italian dishes. Even though I love lots of foods, my favorite by far would most likely be French food. French food is heavy, lots of butter and sauces, so I don't eat it often. When I do eat it, I eat it in style and order my favorite dishes which include Truffled potatoes and for an entree something called "Mixed Game". Mixed game is basically a mix of quail, chicken, and some other birds assorted in a decadent sauce. I normally eat French food at a restuarant called Pamplemousse Grille. It's located on Del Mar Heights road. The images below will provide examples of these dishes. </p>
