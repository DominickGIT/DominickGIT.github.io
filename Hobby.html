 <h2>My Hobbies:</h2>

<p>My hobbies include bodyboarding, filming, and backpacking. The number one top hobby that I think I love the most is bodyboarding. I go bodyboarding almost every week, and in summer, at least every other day. I have grown greatly in my skills in bodyboarding, and in a few years I should be ready for competitive tournaments. Backpacking is also a big part of my life, I go whenever I have the time with my parents, which isn't often. When I do go backpacking, I do extremely strenuous hikes such as Mt. Whitney and Mt. San Gorgonio in Southern California. I plan on making the trip up to Mt. Williamson next summer, but the elevation gain is insane. It's ~10,200ft, which is like going to the top of Mt. San Jacinto in SoCal from sea level in only 15 miles! In the meantime, I have to train for a hike/trip of that magnitude.
