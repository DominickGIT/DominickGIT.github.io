<h2>Future Career</h2>         <!Hi>


<p>My future career is to be a chemist. Though I don't exactly know which type of chemist yet, I do know that I love the idea of combining elements and compounds to make something else. This is both visually pleasing and physically pleasing to do, and I have learned that I must work hard to become what I dream. An average chemist working for a lab will get payed about $50-$60 per hour, and that is quite a lot of money per hour compared to minimum wage. Per year, chemists get paid a little over $100k. Some chemists excel in their line of work, and invent new products making them instant millionaires. In order to become a chemist, one needs to be the following; MD certified in clinical or anatomic pathology OR
PhD in chemical, physical, biological, or clinical lab science plus ABCC or NRCC laboratory director board-certification.
2+ years of technical director experience in CLIA toxicology laboratory environment.
Experience with clinical regulatory requirements.
Qualified to direct a clinical chemistry / toxicology lab in all 50 states including Nevada, California, Florida, and New York.
PhD Candidates must have current director-level Clinical Chemist or Clinical Toxicologist licensure in the state of California and New York State C of Q in Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology.
