 <h2>Favorite Books</h2>
 
 <p>My favorite book series has to be the Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien. In it, he weaves a masterful tale of dragons, humor, and adventure at every turn. The main character of the series is Frodo Baggins, who strives to be adventurous like his grandfather Bilbo Baggins. He gets a task from Gandalf, his wizard friend, whcih tells him to safeguard and destroy an evil magic ring created by Sauron, who is the evil lord who rules over the land of Mordor. He is not alone on this task however, and is accompanied by a diversity of elves, dwarves, and morta; men. The names of his company are as follows; Aragorn, Gimli, Gandalf, Pippin, Merry, Samwise, Legolas, and Boromir. Together, they strive to destroy the evil ring once and for all, which in turn will kill Sauron who looms over them with his one evil eye. The book also happens to be a very successful movie series also, but because of how long the books are, it had to be split up into three individual movies. The movie covers are shown below.
