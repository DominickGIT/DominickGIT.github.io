    <h2>About me:</h2>
    
    <p>I love going to the beach, and hiking as well. I have little experience coding but I would like to learn more about it. I go bodyboarding at least once a week, and I go backpacking about once every two months. I live in Solana Beach, California with one cat who's name is Max, and my mother and father of course. I am fifteen years old and I attend Canyon Crest Academy in Carmel Valley, California. </p>

<b> The video above is from a backpacking trip I did in Kearsarge Pass. The one below is a trip to La Jolla I made. I am bodysurfing the wave with my Gopro Hero 5 Black.
